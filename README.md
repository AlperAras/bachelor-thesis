Bachelor thesis: Estimating nanostructure geometry using ML and DL on diffraction data.

This repository contains the work-in-progress code and documentation for my bachelor thesis project on estimating nanostructure geometries using deep learning.

> **Status**:  In progress â€“ thesis writing & final experiments ongoing

##  Project Description

The goal of this project is to estimate the geometry and refractive index of nanostructured grating symmetric line grating from optical response data, using machine learning and deep learning techniques.

## Repository Structure

- `notebooks/`: Jupyter Notebooks for experiments (data prep, training, evaluation)
- `models/`: Trained models (e.g., `saved_model.keras`)
- `figures/`: Plots used or generated during analysis
- `thesis/`: Draft documents or LaTeX source (optional)
- `README.md`: This file

##  Roadmap

- [x] Data preprocessing and formatting
- [x] Model for symmetric line grating
- [x] Trained and saved .keras model
- [ ] Write final report
- [ ] Final evaluation + tuning
